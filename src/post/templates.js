Added documentation updates today 📘

Sometimes small changes like better docs and visuals make a project 10x easier to understand.
Keeping docs in sync with code is underrated but essential.

What's one thing you document every time?

    tech_stack_update: `
Updated the tech stack mentions in the project 🛠️

Being transparent about what powers your project helps others learn and contribute.
Every line of documentation matters.

Building in public, one commit at a time.

    async_patterns: `
Worked on async handling today.

Promises and async/await look simple until edge cases show up.
Refactoring with clearer async flows improved readability and error handling.

Still learning—always improving.

    engineering_tradeoff: `
Made a technical change that required careful consideration today.

Not all changes are about features—some are about making future work safer and faster.
These decisions rarely show up in demos, but they matter most.

Engineering is about trade-offs.
`,
    error_handling: `
Improved error handling today.

Good error handling is invisible when it works, but saves hours when things break.
Every try-catch block is a future debugging session prevented.

Defense in depth.
`,
    networking: `
Worked on network calls today.

APIs are great until they're not. Proper error handling, retries, and timeouts matter.
The difference between a flaky app and a reliable one is how you handle failures.

Resilience by design.

    large_change: `
Big refactor today. 500+ lines changed.

Large changes are risky but sometimes necessary for long-term maintainability.
Careful testing and incremental commits make big changes manageable.

Progress over perfection.
